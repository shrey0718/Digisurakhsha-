# Cybersecurity Challenges Repository

Welcome to my repository of cybersecurity challenges! This repository houses detailed reports and write-ups for both TryHackMe challenges and wargame challenges (Natas, Leviathan, Krypton). Whether you're new to cybersecurity or an experienced pentester, these documented experiences are designed to help you learn from my methodology, understand exploitation techniques, and sharpen your skills.

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey and learning experiences across various cybersecurity challenges. It is divided into two primary sections: a collection of TryHackMe challenges and a set of wargame challenges including Natas, Leviathan, and Krypton. Each challenge report details everything from the challenge description and enumeration process to exploitation steps and post-exploitation learnings. Through abundant screenshots, code snippets, and personal insights, my goal is to create a resource that fosters learning and inspires further exploration in the field of cybersecurity.
Each section is compartmentalized to help you quickly locate the challenge you’re interested in, along with all support files associated with that challenge.

## TryHackMe Challenges

### Overview & Methodology
The **TryHackMe** challenges are designed to test and improve your offensive security skills in a controlled environment. Each challenge is tackled using a step-by-step methodology that includes:
- **Enumeration:** Identifying live hosts, open ports, and vulnerabilities using tools such as `nmap`, `gobuster`, or custom scripts.
- **Exploitation:** Detailed walkthroughs on how vulnerabilities were exploited to gain access or retrieve flags.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Analysis, further access, pivoting techniques, and cleanup procedures.
- **Reflections:** Insights on challenges encountered, best practices, and lessons learned to strengthen your cybersecurity acumen.

### Challenge Report Structure
A typical TryHackMe report includes:
- **Introduction:** Overview of the challenge, context, and objectives.
- **Environment Setup:** Tools and configurations used for the challenge.
- **Step-by-Step Walkthrough:** Commands, scripts, and screenshots illustrating each phase.
- **Results:** Flag capture, access confirmation, and evidential proof.
- **Key Takeaways:** Personal reflections and tips for overcoming similar challenges.

## Wargame Challenges

The wargame challenges are organized into three groups. Each set is tailored for incremental learning and reflects real-world vulnerabilities with comprehensive documentation.

### Natas
The **Natas** series is a sequential set of web-based challenges that progressively reveal common security flaws in web applications. Against each level, you will find:
- **Overview of the Vulnerability:** Detailed explanation of the web security issue.
- **Step-by-Step Exploitation:** Commands and scripts used to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- **Screenshots & Evidence:** Visual aids to support the walkthrough.
- **Lessons Learned:** Key concepts and takeaways from each exploit.

Start with Level 01 and progress as you master each challenge in the [Natas](./wargames/natas/) folder.

### Leviathan
The **Leviathan** challenges venture into more advanced territories:
- **Complex Exploits:** Dive into directory traversal, code injection, and other sophisticated techniques.
- **In-Depth Analysis:** A breakdown of how each vulnerability is exploited and considerations on why it exists.
- **Remediation Tips:** Discussion on potential fixes and how to avoid such vulnerabilities in real-life systems.

Detailed guides are available in the [Leviathan](./wargames/leviathan/) directory.

### Krypton
The **Krypton** challenges blend classic puzzles with modern exploitation:
- **Diverse Techniques:** Cover topics like network sniffing, custom scripting, and bypassing certain security controls.
- **Step-by-Step Documentation:** Walkthroughs with annotations explaining each command and its purpose.
- **Real-World Parallels:** Insights into how these vulnerabilities could manifest in real-world applications and how to mitigate them.

Explore the [Krypton](./wargames/krypton/) directory to begin your journey with these challenges.
